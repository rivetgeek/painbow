# painbow
A naive implementation of rainbow table generator.

This was a old test to make a rainbow table generator, mostly so i could grasp the underlying concepts, but also because my boss didnt believe a hashed credit card could be cracked.

You may find something of use here, but I doubt it. I have no plans to update this code, as its now 10 years old and likely embarassingly bad. The reduction function isnt particularly interesting, and is definitely not efficient.
